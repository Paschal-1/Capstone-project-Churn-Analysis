## 🔎 Key Questions
- Which customer segments show the highest churn?  
- What are the main reasons customers churn?  
- Does contract type or payment method influence churn?  
- Where should retention efforts be prioritized?

## 🔍 Key Findings (high level)
- **Overall churn rate:** 26.86% (1796 churned of 6687 customers).  
- **Highest churn by contract:** Month-to-month customers show a much higher churn (~46.3%) than yearly contracts (~6.6%).  
- **Top churn reasons:** Competitor offers, price, and dissatisfaction account for the bulk of churn.  
- **Payment method:** Direct debit customers had the lowest churn compared to credit card and paper check.
